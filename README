This is a NIC template for theos that generates an empty project for creating an SBSettings toggle.

This contains all the required and optional functions that a toggle requires and also a convenience method for getting the SBSettings window.
It also creates folders for the default themes in which to place the toggle icons.

To install this place it in template/iphone in the theos folder, then run bin/nic.pl to use it.
